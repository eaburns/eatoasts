<p>My name is Ethan Burns. I recently graduated from the University of
New Hampshire with my Ph.D. in Computer Science. I will be
working at <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> beginning in
August 2013.</p>

<p>While at UNH, I was a member of the <a
href="http://unh-ai.pbwiki.com/">UNH AI Group</a>, where I worked with
Professor <a href="http://www.cs.unh.edu/~ruml">Wheeler Ruml</a> in
the area of heuristic search. My interests include automated planning,
heuristic search, parallel search, combinatorial optimization, and
model checking, among other things. My full CV is available <a
href="static/cv.pdf">here</a>.</p>

    <p class="abstract">
Abstract: <em>Graduate students tend to generate a lot of data, both to
understand their new ideas and to demonstrate to others which of their
ideas work well.  It is often tempting to display this data in an
easy-to-create raw format such as a table filled with numbers.
Unfortunately, such formats fail to truly show the information that the
data provides, because it is difficult to see trends in a mess of raw
numbers.  Luckily, there are many effective techniques for displaying
data graphically that allow us to quickly and clearly see what is really
going on.  I will present a set of useful methods for plotting data
along with a brief introduction to the tools that I have used in my own
research to help me see the results of the many, many experiments that I
have run over my career as a graduate student.</em>

<h3>Experience</h3>

<h4>Research Assistantship</h4>
<p>
From the fall of 2008 to the fall of 2012, I was a research assistant
for Professor Wheeler Ruml.  During this time, I did research on
parallel heuristic search, disk-based heuristic search, hierarchical
search, state space size estimation, continual planning with goal
arrivals, and robot motion planning.
</p>

<h4>Palo Alto Research Center</h4>

<p>
During the summer of 2011 I worked as an intern at the <a
href="http://www.parc.com">Palo Alto Research Center</a> (PARC).  While
there, I did research with Dr. <a
href="http://www.parc.com/about/people/226/rong-zhou.html">Rong Zhou</a>
on parallel search for model checking with the <a
href="http://spinroot.com">Spin</a> model checker.
</p>

<h4>Teaching Assistantship</h4>

<p>
I have been a teaching assistant at the University of New Hampshire for
a variety of courses including: Algorithms (2010), Introduction to
Artificial Intelligence (2009), and Object-oriented Methodology
(2006-2008).
</p>

<h4>University of New Hampshire InterOperability Lab</h4>

<p>
I worked for the <a href="http://www.iol.unh.edu">UNH-IOL</a> for most
of my undergraduate and master's degrees.  While I was at the IOL I
worked in the following consortia:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    iWARP - Here I worked on development
    for <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/unh-iscsi/">UNH-iSCSI</a>
    (with iSER) and SoftWARP (a software iWARP implementation for the
    Linux kernel).
  </li>

  <li>
    iSCSI - I did some of my work on the iSCSI Extensions for RDMA
    (iSER) in the iSCSI group.
  </li>

  <li>
    IPv6 - I worked in the IPv6 consortium adding support for IPSec
    and IKE over IPv6 to an in-house testing tool.
  </li>

  <li>
    IPv4 - I worked in the IPv4 consortium adding support for the
    Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to an in-house testing tool.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Current Projects</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    My heuristic search research code is available on
    <a href="https://github.com/eaburns/search">github</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://feed--me.appspot.com">Feedme</a> is a simple
   RSS and Atom feed reader with an acme-like look and feel. It is
   written in the <a href="http://www.golang.org">Go</a>
    programming language, and runs on the <a
    href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/"> Google App
    Engine</a>. The source code is available <a
    href="https://github.com/velour/feedme">here</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://code.google.com/p/plotinum">Plotinum</a> is a
    plotting package for the <a href="http://www.golang.org">Go</a>
    programming language.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://code.google.com/p/caml-spt">SPT</a> is a simple
    plotting tool written in Objective Caml.  SPT serves as an OCaml
    library for plotting and it comes with a tool
    called <em>spt-it-out</em> for plotting from the command-line
    using a simple input file format.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Previous Projects</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mid-game/">Mid</a> is small
    adventure game that I worked on for a bit with <a
    href="http://www.cs.unh.edu/~stk5">Steve McCoy</a>.  It is
    a 2D platform game, however, each 'level' has doors leading back
    and forth between z layers making for a 3D-style maze.  The
    automatic content generation uses a pipeline allowing you to plug
    in different programs to generate the different level features
    such as the maze, interactive environment objects, items, and
    enemies.  Steve did all of the art so it looks better than any
    other games that I have ever worked on.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a href="archives/liblinuxkernel.tar.bz2">liblinuxkernel</a> is a
    small library
    that <a href="http://www.cs.unh.edu/~rdr">Dr. Russell</a> and I
    wrote while I was working on my Master's thesis.  Basically, it
    implements some of the Linux kernel API in user space to allow
    some kernel code to compile completely in user space.  We used
    this library to enable the UNH-iSCSI driver for Linux to run
    completely in user space.
  </li>
  <li>
    My CS830 <a href="archives/wumpus_hunter.tar.bz2">final
    project</a> was a bot that will play the old BSD hunt the wumpus
    game. The bot uses an algorithm based on maintaining arc
    consistency along with a tiny CSP solver to make inferences about
    the locations of pits and the evil wumpus.  Using this
    information, a planner selects rooms to explore that it suspects
    are safe. Eventually the bot can often locate and shoot the wumpus
    to beat the game. The bot is better than the average human player
    who and is about on par with a good human player (but obviously,
    the bot is <b>much</b> faster than any human).
  </li>

  <li>
    When studying for the compiler design qual., I made a simple lexer
    generator called <a href="archives/lexit.tar.bz2">lexit</a>.  It
    reads a simple description and builds an automata to do string
    tokenizing.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a href="http://www.gna.org/projects/glutboard">Glutboard</a> is a
    project that I did while I was an undergrad in order to experiment with
    OpenGL and computer graphics.  It is a 3D chessboard front-end for
    gnuchess which uses the OpenGL and Glut libraries. It supports both
    simple and projected shadows, reflections, full-scene anti-aliasing,
    highlighting of in-danger pieces, and highlighting legal moves.

<h3>Files</h3>

Some useful configuration files:

<ul>
  <li>
    My <a href="static/dot.screenrc">.screenrc</a> file.
  </li>

  <li>
    My <a href="static/dot.acme">.acme</a> file with <a
    href="http://swtch.com/plan9port/">acme</a> configuration.
  </li>

  <li>
    My <a href="static/dot.emacs">.emacs</a> file.  Automatically does setup
    for the UNH-AI research machines if you are logged in from one.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a href="static/la-mode.el">tla-mode</a> for emacs
    (<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/users/lamport/tla/tla.html">
    TLA+</a>).  This is a modified version of a file that I found in
    the tubes.  I fixed this because the syntax highlighting was
    broken.  Additionally, this appears to have TLA+ indentation
    support and a few small functions like "comment-region" and
    "un-comment-region".
  </li>

  <li> <a href="static/tla.vim">tla.vim</a> for TLA+ on vim (thanks to Matt
